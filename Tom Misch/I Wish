I wish you'd known
How far I'd go
I was lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
I was lost in my mind

E   F#m9    Emaj7
I wish you'd seen
Who I could have been
I was lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
I was stuck in my mind

Amaj7/D            F#m11
When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky

Amaj7/D            F#m11
When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky

Amaj7/D            F#m11
When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky

Emaj7   F#m9    Emaj7
I miss the way
We laughed that day
When you were mine
When you were mine
Still stuck in my mind

E   F#m9    Emaj7
I miss the thrill
Stays with me still
All of the time
All of the time
Still stuck in my mind

Amaj7/D            F#m11
When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky

When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky

When you go, you go, you go
F#/G#  G#/A#
I'm a sunless sky
